This project revolves around the development of a robust fraud detection model for credit card transactions, leveraging the power of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. The project encompasses the following key stages:

Read Dataset:

Import the credit card transaction dataset for thorough analysis.
Data Exploration:

Count the occurrences of fraud and non-fraud records to understand the distribution.
Select a representative sample of records for a detailed investigation.
Determine and address the count of null values to ensure data completeness.
Identify and handle duplicate records to maintain dataset integrity.
Descriptive Analysis:

Conduct a comprehensive descriptive analysis to unveil underlying patterns, trends, and statistical properties related to fraud and non-fraud transactions.
Data Preprocessing:

Drop duplicate records to refine the dataset.
Split the dataset into features and labels to prepare for model training.
Identify and remove outliers for improved model robustness.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model generalization.
Select the top effective features derived from EDA findings.
Apply standard scaling to ensure consistency in feature scales.
Model Selection, Evaluation & Prediction:

Train a Decision Tree model on the preprocessed data.
Plot the Decision Tree model for visual interpretation.
Evaluate the Decision Tree model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance in detecting fraud and non-fraud transactions.
Gradient Boosting Model:

Train a Gradient Boosting model on the dataset.
Evaluate the model and plot the confusion matrix.
Explore potential overfitting or underfitting and address if necessary.
Implement cross-validation to ensure model stability.
Logistic Regression Model:

Train a Logistic Regression model on the preprocessed data.
Evaluate the model and plot the confusion matrix.
Address overfitting or underfitting if observed.
Implement cross-validation for model validation.
KNN Model, Random Forest Model, Naive Bayes Model:

Train additional models (KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) for comparison.
Evaluate each model and explore potential overfitting or underfitting.
This holistic approach, combining EDA and multiple models, aims to create a robust fraud detection system for credit card transactions, ensuring accurate identification and prevention of fraudulent activities.
